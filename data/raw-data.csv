Even as resources are increasingly scarce, there is a pressing and urgent need to triage and prioritise where governments invest, and the rules and policies that govern distribution of these resources.

With a range of daily problems, requests and complaints streaminghow in to the government everyday, somebody has to make sense of how to group, prioritise and tackle these problems.

Every team within the government has its own limited resources and constraints. There is a need to coopt the attention and interest of these other teams with the promise of a good outcome.

Good outcomes are defined by their ability to contribute to measurable citizen satisfaction, and to positive affect towards civic services.

A range of guerilla Robin Hood-style community organisations have sprung up, with the nimbleness to speedily tackle problems and break the rules to make quick fixes.

One of your personal beliefs is that their engagement is vital to helping to solve some of the issues that are coming up. You’re keen to understand how these partnerships might happen, and open to doing so quietly and experimentally.

Another pattern that is providing hope is increased ability for frugal innovation and ground-up efforts at scrounging and recycling existing resources. You wonder if there is a way to open-source some of the existing “dead systems” and abandoned code that exists within the government, so that independents can make use of this “waste” infrastructure.","Resource and Allegiance Coordinator","After the proliferation of data and wealth in the 2000s, the earth hit a point of resource famine. Since then, there is increased scarcity among resources, and governments have had to prioritise their interventions.

Increased civic discontentment has resulted in a need for agents who can broker deals with self-organised groups of citizens who are agitating for change and different priorities.

There is a need for a coordinator to align their allegiances to that of the government, by ensuring that resources are shared and allocated in a meaningful way. 

This restores the sense of connectedness and possibility within an otherwise fraught society.","The world is a tapestry that’s resolving itself into a series of tangled tassels.

This person is currently sitting comfortably in their workspace. It's quiet, and daylight streams in through the floor to ceiling windows. They're situated somewhere in the mountains, in a sustainably built bungalow. When you look out, you see the view. 

Maybe the view sucks, cause the world didnt manage to figure out how to stop climate change/collapse. 

Or maybe the view is amazing, cause we somehow managed to reverse the environmental damage. 

Remote work is possible. This person can move to another place on earth easily, and their organisation/team is flexible with that

They're working with an environmentally conscious company, that's either global, or that is able to easily work with other companies in other parts of the world.

This person's role is a smaller cog in this machine, but basically helps to build a product that's easy and efficient for other humans to use.

Covid has kickstarted that process where people are starting to examine what they actually want to do with their lives. I also see urban population growth slowing as technology has enabled many ppl to work remotely. An urban life is not seen as necessarily better than a more rural or suburban one.","It’s tied to the social. As the world population ages, there will be less ppl of working age providing goods and services. There will be a manpower crunch but also necessarily innovation and mindset change around how we provide the products and services that ppl need with less manpower - this can be in the form of automation or more self-service. This could be beneficial if this enables more ppl to access products and services at lower cost. However this could also create an imbalance if the the ownership of the automation is in the hands of a few elite individuals. Due to the manpower crunch, I see that workers can start to demand for better working conditions and this includes arrangements like WFH, flexible hours, 4 day work weeks. Economic power is also likely to shift to countries with younger populations such as India and Africa","climate change, while a relatively slow process, is getting more obvious in the impact that it has on people’s lives. tied to the social, as ppl reflect more on what they want out of their lives, and with increased awareness of their lifestyles on the climate, it feels that ppl will create new narratives on what it means to live a good life","she is working in a lab, conducting experiments with people and collecting data on it","Human behaviour analyst","the shift in understanding of how people make decisions - right now people are largely thought to be “rational”. but the next century will see a shift to see human behaviour in a more holistic way","diversity is beauty",Design,,"Studio Dojo FB"
