A range of guerilla Robin Hood-style community organisations have sprung up, with the nimbleness to speedily tackle problems and break the rules to make quick fixes. One of your personal beliefs is that their engagement is vital to helping to solve some of the issues that are coming up. You’re keen to understand how these partnerships might happen, and open to doing so quietly and experimentally.",
