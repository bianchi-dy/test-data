Even as resources are increasingly scarce, there is a pressing and urgent need to triage and prioritise where governments invest, and the rules and policies that govern distribution of these resources.

With a range of daily problems, requests and complaints streaminghow in to the government everyday, somebody has to make sense of how to group, prioritise and tackle these problems.

Every team within the government has its own limited resources and constraints. There is a need to coopt the attention and interest of these other teams with the promise of a good outcome.

Good outcomes are defined by their ability to contribute to measurable citizen satisfaction, and to positive affect towards civic services.

A range of guerilla Robin Hood-style community organisations have sprung up, with the nimbleness to speedily tackle problems and break the rules to make quick fixes.

One of your personal beliefs is that their engagement is vital to helping to solve some of the issues that are coming up. You’re keen to understand how these partnerships might happen, and open to doing so quietly and experimentally.

Another pattern that is providing hope is increased ability for frugal innovation and ground-up efforts at scrounging and recycling existing resources. You wonder if there is a way to open-source some of the existing “dead systems” and abandoned code that exists within the government, so that independents can make use of this “waste” infrastructure.",Resource and Allegiance Coordinator,"After the proliferation of data and wealth in the 2000s, the earth hit a point of resource famine. Since then, there is increased scarcity among resources, and governments have had to prioritise their interventions.

Increased civic discontentment has resulted in a need for agents who can broker deals with self-organised groups of citizens who are agitating for change and different priorities.

There is a need for a coordinator to align their allegiances to that of the government, by ensuring that resources are shared and allocated in a meaningful way.
